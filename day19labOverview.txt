So for the day 19 lab we need to understand the dtp there are four modes and also dtp only occur between switches
trunk, access , dynamic desirable and dynamic auto

and by defaut it is dynamic auto
To turn that dtp you need to first convert the port to trunk
switchport mode trunk
and then
switchport nonegotiate (non would work)
to check if it disabled or not you can use sh int g0/1 sw

for the vtp the vtp is null
And first we need to give the domain 
vtp domain name (ccna)
do sh vtp status
to make sure
now if i add the vtp on this then the vlan  would be available for the vtp
do sh vlan brief
vtp mode transport to convert it into the transport mode
Now imp thing it is adviced to turn of the vtp for the pc connecting interfaces of the switches and to do that
we can just convert that to the access mode and then later on tell the vlan
int g0/1
sw mode access
sw access vlan 20
done now the dtp is disabled that means no trunking protocol and also the switch won't receive anything even if the vtp is on but for security reason we turn that off
so for turning off dtp the upper process work
and for the vtp it is simple turn the domain to the null or just make it transparent
