For this lab we are focusing on the access port 
So basically the subnetting is done on the router but all the connection is still connected to the same switch in case somebody makes a broadcast req it goes to all the pcs but to stop that we divide them into the vlans
Now we take 3 connections from router (basically subnet) now in the switch we make them connected and configure on it which one belongs to which vlan
so router connecting interface and its pc on the vlan belong to the same subnet
the commands are int range g1/1,f5/1,f6/1
switchport mode access
switch access vlan 20
now even if the vlan doesn't exit it is going to be created 
and to check the vlan connections
we go do show vlan brief
