For the lab the router is router on stick and now we have accuqired a 3 layer switch
Now the trunk route is gone we will replace it
For that
no int g0/0.10 that is it and then we will give a proper ip address on the g0/0 interface better to use the 30 subnet address

now on the switch we need to do the main part
first fix the interface of the router with the switch
default int g1/0/2
this makes it change from the trunk conf
now add the ip address and connect it and also the interface is in 2 layer to make it assign the layer 3 ip address we need
 no switchport 
and then add the address

And also to enable the route we need
ip routing command

Now configure the default route to the router 

Now for the vlan we need the svi
for the svi it is farely easy now what you need to do is make the vlan first 
and then 
int vlan 10
ip add 10.0.0.126 255.255.255.254
do that for all of the vlan's
