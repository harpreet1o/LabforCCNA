The important commands are 
show ip interface brief can check which interface is on and what is its ip addresss
int g0/0 lets you get into the interface and assign ip
ip address value(10.0.0.0) subnetmask(255.0.0.0) helps to assign the ip address to the interface of the router

Key takeways The trick to remember this range is half of 128 is 64 = 192, half of 64 is 32 and 192+32= 224
The class A is 0-127 but 0 and 127 are not used, the starting bit is 0 and the network number is 128 because 2power 7 and not 2 power 8 because 1 bit is 0 and the possible networks addresses are 2 power 24
The class B is 128-191 and the starting bit is 10 and the network is 2power 14 because 2 bits are now fixed and also the network address 2 power 16
The class C is 192-223 and the starting bit is 110 and the network is 2 power 21 because 3 bits now fixed and also the network address is 2 power 8 256 
Important note the network address number is always 2 power number -2 because the first value is always network address and the last value is broadcast address
